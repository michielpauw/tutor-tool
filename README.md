# tutor-tool

By Michiel Pauw

The purpose of this application is to diagnose bugs that occur in simple arithmetic (subtraction) problems. Simple arithmetic involves quite a lot of steps that can go wrong. In subtraction alone one must compare numbers, see if one needs to borrow, etc. The user fills in answers to problems and if he/she makes mistakes, the application will determine which bugs are a possible explanation for the mistakes. After such bugs are diagnosed, a teacher or tutor can help the user to understand what he/she is doing wrong. Therefore, the fixing of a specific bug is not within the scope of this application.
